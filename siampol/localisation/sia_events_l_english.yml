 sia_siam.1.t:0 "Dissolution of the People's Assembly"
 sia_siam.1.d:0 "[SIA.GetLeader]'s charisma and political acumen have long been able to bridge the deep ideological divides within the People's Assembly.\nHis steady leadership has guided [SIA.GetName] through several crises.\n\nBut a scandal involving the cheap sale of Royal lands to State Ministers has broken down any cooperation within the government. Calls for resignations and outrage from the public are bringing governance to a grinding-halt.\n\nThe only way forward is to dissolve the assembly, and open up elections for new representatives."
 sia_siam.1.a:0 "The people will have their say."
 sia_siam.2.t:0 "A Landslide Victory for the Fascists"
 sia_siam.2.d:0 "The people have spoken. Unfortunately, it is not in our favor.\n\nMembers of the former ruling coalition have been resoundingly rejected, delivering a clear majority to Fascist candidates. Whether they can deliver on their promises remains to be seen.\n\nThe composition of this new People's Assembly presents the existing leadership with an unworkable problem.\nRecognising that the tide has turned, [SIA.GetLeader] has now announced his resignation.\n\nFascism has truly risen in [SIA.GetName]."
 sia_siam.2.a:0 "Ah. That did not go to plan..."

 sia_siam.3.t:0 "Removing the influence of the Khana Ratsadon"
 sia_siam.3.d:0 "The influence of the Khana Ratsadon runs deep through the Government and Military. If we do not take action, our days in power will be numbered.\n\nThere are rumors of a coup planned and led by Phraya Songsuradet, a former Minister of State and an active Military Commander.\nThere is no doubt that the fingerprints of this old guard would be all over such a plan.\n\nWe can use this to connect them all together."
 sia_siam.3.a:0 "These rumors are evidence enough! We must strike now."
 sia_siam.6.t:0 "A Trial of villains and traitors"
 sia_siam.6.d:0 "Although Phraya Songsuradet somehow escaped our trap, fleeing to Cambodia, his rebellion has been nipped in the bud.\n\nWe have struck a decisive blow against these would be saboteurs and rebels. Effectively removing the leadership of the Khana Ratsadon, and pacifying the threat they pose.\n\nTheir indefensible treasons will be brought to light in these trials.\nLet their fate be an example to those who would dare threaten [SIA.GetNameDef]!"
 sia_siam.6.a:0 "Let the show begin!"

 sia_siam.7.t:0 "A Royal Choice"
 sia_siam.7.d:0 "King Rama VIII is a king in absentia, having spent his life in Switzerland since the fall of his father.\nBarely more than a child, his position would be a symbolic one for the people to rally around.\n\nThere is however another choice.\n\nPrince Bowowradet is an experienced former military commander - useful skills for these turbulent times. His failed rebellion of 1932 sought the restoration of Royal power, and since then he has lived in exile in French Indochina.\n\nThe future of [SIA.GetNameDef] rests upon this decision."
 sia_siam.7.a:0 "King Rama VIII will bring us Democracy and Peace."
 sia_siam.7.a.tt:0 "There is a chance for §YCivil War§! or a §YPeaceful Transition§! to Democracy."
 sia_siam.7.b:0 "Prince Bowowradet shall take back what is rightfully his."
 sia_siam.7.b.tt:0 "The return of an Absolute Monarchy will certainly result in a §YCivil War§!"
 sia_siam.8.t:0 "The Return of King Rama VIII"
 sia_siam.8.d:0 "King Rama VIII has returned to take his rightful place on the throne of [SIA.GetName]. The powerful combination of tradition and thinly veiled threats from the Western powers have resulted in the resignation of [SIA.GetLeader].\n\nUpon his arrival in [SIA.GetName], the King reaffirmed his commitment to a peaceful transition into Democracy."
 sia_siam.8.a:0 "Long live the King!"
 sia_siam.9.t:0 "The Second Bowowradet Rebellion"
 sia_siam.9.d:0 "Returning from exile in French Indochina, Prince Bowowradet has announced his intention to restore the throne of [SIA.GetNameDef].\n\nIt remains to be seen if this second rebellion will meet the same fate as the first."
 sia_siam.9.a:0 "Blood will flow in the Streets"
 sia_siam.10.t:0 "Assassination attempt on King Rama VIII"
 sia_siam.10.d:0 "Hours before returning to [SIA.GetNameDef], an attempt has been made on the life of King Rama VIII.\n\nThis has sent the clear message that the Fascist government has no intention of surrendering power.\n\nThe struggle has just begun."
 sia_siam.10.a:0 "The path to freedom is paved with blood."

 sia_siam.11.t:0 "[SIA.GetNameDef] demands return of Cambodia & Laos"
 sia_siam.11.d:0 "[SIA.GetNameDef] have demanded we hand over the territories of Cambodia and Laos, which are the bulk of our colonial possessions in Indochina. A truly galling suggestion.\n\nSovereignty of these territories were willingly signed over by [SIA.GetNameDef] in return for peace in 1893.\nAlthough such a concession would be appaling, it could prevent a war on the other side of the world."
 sia_siam.11.a:0 "Let them have it. A distant war is the last thing we need."
 sia_siam.11.b:0 "Indochina will remain French! Let them try to take it."

 sia_siam.12.d:0 "The age of dominance for the European powers is over, and a new era has dawned.\n\n[FRA.GetName] has returned Cambodia and Laos to us; territories which were never rightfully theirs. Our people have long been seperated by European greed, but now they have returned home.\n\nThis great victory today is the first of many to come, as our power in Asia grows."
 sia_siam.12.a:0 "A Great Victory for [SIA.GetNameDef]"
 sia_siam.13.t:0 "[FRA.GetName] Refuses our demands"
 sia_siam.13.d:0 "The hubris of the Europeans knows no bounds!\n\n[FRA.GetLeader] has refused our reasonable demands for the return of our rightful lands. Such a slight cannot go unanswered."
 sia_siam.13.a:0 "They will be taught a lesson."

 sia_siam.14.t:0 "Offer Alliance to [JAP.GetNameDef]"
 sia_siam.14.d:0 "We are in a difficult position. Without the power of [JAP.GetNameDef] behind us, the old European Empires will greedily eye our lands.\n\nHowever, approaching the Japanese is fraught with danger. The Japanese leadership are not fools - they can see the difficulties of our position, and are ambitious to expand their territories.\n\nBy approaching [JAP.GetNameDef] now, maybe we can join them as equals - rather than Slaves."
 sia_siam.14.a:0 "Our future depends on these negotiations..."
 sia_siam.15.t:0 "[SIA.GetNameDef] Proposes an Alliance"
 sia_siam.15.d:0 "Diplomats from [SIA.GetNameDef] have approached us with an offer of a formal Alliance.\n\nThere is no doubt that [SIA.GetNameDef] would benefit greatly from such an arrangement, with the strength of our Glorious Nation behind them.\nAlthough [SIA.GetNameDef] is not an industrial powerhouse, their territories present many strategic options.\n\nBut, we do not need to accept them as a partner. We can instead demand their subjugation."
 sia_siam.15.a:0 "Sign a formal treaty of Alliance"
 sia_siam.15.b:0 "There will be no Alliance. But they can be our subject..."

 sia_siam.16.d:0 "Our diplomatic mission has been a success! [JAP.GetNameDef] has agreed to our request and signed a formal treaty of alliance!"
 sia_siam.16.a:0 "Together we will forge a new world."

 sia_siam.17.t:0 "[SIA.GetNameDef] Proposes an Alliance"
 sia_siam.17.d:0 "Diplomats from [SIA.GetNameDef] have approached us with an offer of a formal Alliance.\nIt is clear that [SIA.GetName] feel threatened by the growing power and influence of [JAP.GetName].\n\n[SIA.GetNameDef] could present a useful ally against [JAP.GetName], or they could become a liability and distraction to our cause."
 sia_siam.17.a:0 "Together we can stop the Fascist menace"
 sia_siam.17.b:0 "[CHI.GetNameDef] does not need their help."
 sia_siam.4.t:0 "[CHI.GetNameDef] have accepted our offer of an Alliance"
 sia_siam.4.d:0 "Our diplomatic efforts have been a resounding success, as [CHI.GetNameDef] have signed a formal treaty of Alliance with us.\n\nPresenting this powerful united front to the world will make our enemies tremble."
 sia_siam.4.a:0 "Together we are Stronger."
 sia_siam.5.t:0 "[CHI.GetNameDef] have declined our offer of an Alliance"
 sia_siam.5.d:0 "[CHI.GetNameDef] have foolishly declined our proposal for a formal treaty of Alliance.\n\nPerhaps this is for the best, as this decision clearly shows [CHI.GetName] is incompetently lead. Binding our fortunes to theirs would also bring us down."

 sia_news.1.d:0 "Siam no longer exists.\nOn the insistence of [SIA.GetLeader], the country will now be known as [SIA.GetNameDef].\n\nThis change has been announced as the first of a series of Cultural Mandates from the central government of [SIA.GetName], aimed at modernizing the nation. The mandates are wildly ambitious, covering topics such as ethnicity, a citizen's duties to the Nation and even defining appropriate clothing in public.\n\nThe move no doubt serves to further cement Fascist power within [SIA.GetNameDef]."
