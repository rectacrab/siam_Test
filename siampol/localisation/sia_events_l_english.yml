 sia_siam.1.d:0 "[SIA.GetLeader]'s' charisma and political acumen have long been able to bridge the deep ideological divides within the People's Assembly.\nHis leadership was able to defeat Royalist rebellions and truly replaced the Monarchy within the Country.\n\nBut a scandal involving the cheap sale of Royal lands to ministers has broken down any cooperation within the government. Calls for the resignation of ministers and outrage from the public are bringing the government to a grinding-halt.\n\nThe only way forward is to dissolve the assembly, and open up elections for new representatives."
 sia_siam.1.a:0 "The people will have their say."

 sia_siam.3.d:0 "There are many powerful people who have been upset by our rise to power; openly questioning our right to rule [SIA.GetName].\nThey have infiltrated both the government and the military, and if their influence spreads, our days will be numbered.\n\nIf we are to survive, we need to move against them now."

 sia_siam.4.a:0 "This was always a risk"

 sia_siam.5.t:0 "Phraya Songsuradet Captured"
 sia_siam.5.d:0 "Phraya Songsuradet is a prominent member of the old guard, with deep influence within the Military.\n\nHe foolishly fell into our trap, and has now been taken captive.\nHis treasons will serve us well in the Trials to come."

 sia_siam.7.t:0 "A Royal Choice"
 sia_siam.7.d:0 "King Rama VIII is the rightful King of [SIA.GetName], but he is barely more than a child. Since the Royal family's loss of Absolute power, he has spent his life in Switzerland.\nHis age and upbringing would ensure his position is only symbolic, enacting the will of the people.\n\nThere is however another choice.\n\nPrince Bowowradet is a former military commander - an experienced and steady hand in these turbulent times. His failed rebellion of 1932 sought the restoration of Absolute Royal power, and since then he has lived in exile in French Indochina.\n\nThe future of [SIA.GetName] rests upon this decision. Who will lead us in these dark times?"

 sia_siam.8.d:0 "King Rama VIII has returned to take his rightful place on the throne of [SIA.GetName].

 sia_siam.8.a:0 "Long live the King!"

 sia_siam.9.t:0 "The Second Bowowradet Rebellion"
 sia_siam.9.d:0 "Returning from exile in French Indochina, Prince Bowowradet has announced his intention to restore the throne of [SIA.GetName].\n\nIt remains to be seen if this second rebellion will meet the same fate as the first."

 sia_siam.13.d:0 "The hubris of the Europeans knows no bounds!\n\n[FRA.GetLeader] has refused our reasonable demands for the return of our rightful lands. Such a slight cannot go unanswered."
 sia_siam.13.a:0 "They will be taught a lesson."

 sia_siam.14.t:0 "Offer Alliance to [JAP.GetNameDef]"
 sia_siam.14.d:0 "We are in a difficult position. Without the power of [JAP.GetNameDef] behind us, the old European Empires will greedily eye our lands.\n\nHowever, approaching the Japanese is fraught with danger. [JAP.GetNameDef] are not fools - they can see the difficulties of our position, and are ambitious to expand their territories.\n\nBy approaching [JAP.GetNameDef] now, maybe we can join them as equals - rather than Slaves."

We can instead demand their subjugation."
